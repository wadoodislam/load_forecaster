# Load forecasting

Using neural nets to predict day-ahead energy trends with as high as 99.5 percent accuracy. Documentation can be found on this [Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-neural-nets-to-predict-tomorrows-electric-consumption-cc1ae3ae7cc2).
Load data comes from ERCOT and temperature data comes from local airports. Research in coordination with the [Open Modeling Framework](omf.coop) (OMF). The OMF's version of this code can be found [here](https://github.com/dpinney/omf/blob/master/omf/loadForecast.py).
